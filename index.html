                            <p> Brunel completed his studies at Henri-IV in 1822, 
                                his father had him presented as a candidate at the 
                                renowned engineering school École Polytechnique, 
                                but as a foreigner, he was deemed ineligible for entry. 
                                Brunel subsequently studied under the prominent master 
                                clockmaker and horologist Abraham-Louis Breguet, who 
                                praised Brunel's potential in letters to his father.
                                In late 1822, having completed his apprenticeship, 
                                Brunel returned to England.</p></div>

                    <q>That is very fine; but it is impossible to make the men 
                        perfect; the men will always remain the same as they are 
                        now; and no legislation will make a man have more presence 
                        of mind, or, I believe, make him more cautious; and besides 
                        that, the next time such an accident occurs, the circumstances will 
                        be so different, that the instructions given to the men, in consequence
